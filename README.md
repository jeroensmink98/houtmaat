Calculate easy to use measurements to sell wood

Price per volume meter (m3) Ppm3 = 1500 euro

thickness in mm = 200
width in mm = 200

Ppm1 (m1) = 60 euro

# Equasion

1. Price per cubic meter (P_pcm) is 1500 euro. This refers to a cubic meter (1m x 1m x 1m) of the material.
2. The thickness is 200 mm = 0.2 m.
3. The width is also 200 mm = 0.2 m.

You're trying to find the price per meter, which refers to a strip of material 1m long, 0.2m wide, and 0.2m thick.

The volume of the strip is:
Volume (V) = length x width x height = 1m * 0.2m * 0.2m = 0.04 cubic meters (m³).

Now you can use the price per cubic meter to find the price of the strip:

Price per meter (P_pm) = P_pcm * volume = 1500 euro/m³ * 0.04 m³ = 60 euro.

So, yes, your calculation is correct! The price would be 60 euro for a strip of the material that's 1m long, 0.2m wide, and 0.2m thick.
